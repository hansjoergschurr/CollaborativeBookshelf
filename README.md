# Collaborative Bookshelf
This project aims to provide groups of friends the a convenient way to share their book collections among each other. 
Users share their collection by importing from the [Book Catalogue](https://github.com/eleybourn/Book-Catalogue) app.

Because of time constraints, the project currently lies dormant. For now consider using [Inventaire.io](https://inventaire.io) which is a mature project with a simmilar goal.
